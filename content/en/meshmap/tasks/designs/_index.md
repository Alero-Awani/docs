Deploying Meshery designs is a common and essential task for managing your infrastructure and workloads. Having a thorough understanding of this procedure and Meshery’s design deployment behavior is key to ensuring that your component configurations work as intended in a live Kubernetes environment. Meshery’s design deployment process not only attests to the validity of your configuration, but also offers a seamless transition from Designer mode to Operator mode, where you can visually inspect your deployment, and begin to manage live-running deployments in your environment.

Meshery’s deployment process encompasses four steps: validation, dry-run, environment selection, and finally, executing the deployment itself.
